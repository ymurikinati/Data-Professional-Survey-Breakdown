The salary of a Data Scientist is higher compared to other professions.

The favorite programming language is Python, while Java is my least favorite.

The highest average salary is in the Real Estate sector in Canada, at 187.50.

PhD holders have a higher average age of 39.80.

It appears that the majority of survey takers indicated that breaking into data analytics is neither easy nor difficult; only 44 people found it very difficult.

The major reason for switching careers is a better salary.

Most PhD holders switched their careers despite having higher salaries.

The average salary is higher for women compared to men.

The United States is the only country with more people who switched their careers.
